                  <li>Put the markers and tickets face down and ensure it does not mix with your main deck.</li>
                  <li>Choose 1 grade 0 card from the deck of 50 cards, and place it on the vanguard circle face down.</li>
                  <li>Shuffle the remaining 49 cards and place them here.</li>
                  <li>Determine who goes first randomly with rock paper scissors or roll a dice for the highest.</li>
                  <li>Draw 5 cards from the top of the deck without showing your opponent to form your hand.</li>
                  <li>Just once, you may return any number of cards your hand to the bottom of your deck, and draw the same number of cards you returned from the top of your deck. Then, shuffle your deck.</li>

                  <h4>Let the Cardfight Begin!</h4>
                  <h6>When both players are ready, it's time to start the fight!</h6>

                  <p>Turn your vanguard face up together with your opponent at the same time by saying "Stand up, Vanguard!" together.
                    The turn starts as soon as the order of play is decided!</p>

                  <h5>Stand & Draw Phases</h5>
                  <p>Each player's turn begins with "Stand" and "Draw" phases. If there are any horizontal cards on the players field (rest), turn them vertial (stand), and draw 1 card from the top of your deck.
                    If there are no cards to stand, drawing 1 card from the top of your deck would be fine.</p>
                  
                  <h5>Ride Phase</h5>
                  <p>You can power up your vanguard once per turn.
                    This called "Ride". Choose a card from your hand that is grade+1 to the vanguard and stack it face up on your vanguard.
                    Your card's power is increased as well!</p>
                  <h5>Call Phase</h5>
                  <p>Summon allies to fight together with your vanguard by "Calling" them to the rear-guard circle.
                    You may call as many units as you want in a turn, but the unit's grade has to be less than or equal to the grade of your vanguard.
                    During this phase, you may also activate 1 Normal Order from your hand.<br>
                    <b>Example:</b> You may call units of grades 2, 1, or 0, when your vanguard is of grade 2.</p>

                  <h5>Attack Step</h5>
                  <p>After powering up your vanguard by "Riding" it and "Calling" allies to your rear-guard circles, it is time to "Attack your opponent's Vanguard."
                    The attacks occur for 1 card at a time.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>First, choose your attacking unit and turn it horizontal to show that the unit has attempted and attack.
                      Only your vanguard and rear-guard units on the front row may attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you have a unit behind the attacking unit with "Boost", you may turn it horizontal as well to add its attack power to the attacking unit.</li>
                    <li>Choose an opponent's unit to attack. You may only attack units on the front row of your opponent's field.
                      (However, the player who starts first may not attack on his or her first turn.)
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <h6><b>Drive Check (when a Vanguard attacks!)</b></h6>
                  <p>When a vanguard attacks, you have a chance to "Drive Check"!
                    Put 1 card from the top of your deck face up on the trigger zone.
                    If it is a trigger unit with an icon on the top right corner of the card, an effect will occur.
                    Add the card from the drive check to your hand!!!
                  </p>

                  <h6><b>Power Calculation</b></h6>
                  <p>Compare the power of the unit that attacked, and the unit that it is being attacked.
                    If the attacking unit's power is higher than or equal to the unit being attacked, the attack will "Hit".
                    If the attack hits a rear-guard, the rear-guard unit is put into the drop zone. If the attack hits a vanguard, "Damage Check" occurs!

                  </p>

                  <h5>Guard Step</h5>
                    <p>The player being attacked may be able to defend the attack.
                    Place a card from your hand onto the  "Guardian Circle" horizontally to add the value of the "Shield" to the power of the unit being attacked.
                    You may place as many cards as you want onto the guardian circle from hand!
                    <br>Additionally, you may play 1 Blitz Order Card during this step!</p>
                    <p>The power up during guard step is only effective for 1 attack.
                      When that attack ends, the power of the defending unit returns to its original value and the cards on the guardian circle go to the drop zone.
                    </p>
                  <h5>Damage Check</h5>
                  <p>When the attack hits an opponent's vanguard, the opponent puts 1 card from the top of his or her deck face up into the trigger zone.
                    That card will go to the damage zone face up, but if it is a trigger unit, its effect will occur.
                    After performing damage check, if there are still units that can attack, return to Attack Step.
                  </p>
                  <b>As you continue making hits on your opponent's vanguard, when the cards in your opponent's damage zone reaches 6, you win!</b>

                  <h5>Special Abilities (Keyword Abilities)</h5>
                  <p>Cards can have all sorts of abilities, but there are special abilities called keyword abilities, that have similar effects and activation conditions.
                  <br/><b>Example:</b>
                  Sentinel - An ability that protects you from your opponent's attack when guarding. Follow what each Sentinel does to up your defenses
                  (You may only have up to four cards with "[CONT]:Sentinel" in a deck.)

                  <p> When you ride a grade 3 unit with the "Accel" gift icon, you can put an "Accel" gift marker as an additional rear-guard circle in your front row, and call units onto it. 
                    Units on these additional circles gain power during your turn.<br> However, as there is no circle in the back row, beware of the inability to boost. 
                    If you ride a unit with "Accel" again, you can put an additional "Accel" gift marker! These markers are placed from left to right and repeats as many times you as you continue gathering accel circles.
                    <br><br>
                    Accel 1 grants an additional front row rear-guard circle and during your turn, the unit gains +10000.<br><br>
                    Accel 2 grants an additional front row rear-guard circle and during your turn, the unit gains +5000, but you draw 1 card after obtaining it.

                    <br><br> 
                    You can add a "Protect" 1 gift marker to your hand, which has the same ability as a "Sentinel". 
                    Although the gift marker needs to be revealed, it can be discarded from your hand as well. 
                    Guard perfectly with the "Protect" that can negate any attack.
                    <br><br>
                    You can place a "Protect" 2 gift marker on your rear-guard circle. The unit on the circle gains +5000 power during either players' turn. 
                    When the unit on a "Protect" 2 marker intercepts, it gains +10000 shield.

                    You, the leader of your various Units, now have a new option! It’s name is “Order” cards!<br>
                    Order in this case means a wide variety of orders, such as strategy, spells, and the use of Items.<br>
                    As the leader of your Units, master “Order”!<br><br>
                    Order Cards are a type of cards that can be used once per turn, and are placed in the Drop Zone after being used.
                    In order to play them, the Grade on your card needs to be equal to or less than the Grade of your Vanguard.<br>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Normal Orders can be played during your main phase.

                    Blitz Orders can be played during your guard step against an opponent's attack.
